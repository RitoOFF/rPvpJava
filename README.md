# Java PVP - PLUGIN 

Hi, this is a plugin that remakes the Java PvP of version 1.9 on the Pocketmine software, called PvpJava this plugin contains the cooldown to hit, the scanning edge, knockback hit, critical hit, sprint hit, arc punch and even casual exchange.

--------------------------------------------------------

## Attack Cooldown :

| Items                       | Cooldown                                                      
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
| `Sword`            | 0.6 seconds    
| `Axe ( Wood, Stone )`     | 1.25 seconds
| `Axe ( Gold, Diamond, Netherite )` | 1 second 
| `Axe ( Iron )`       | 1.1 seconds

> While you no longer want your item and there is the animation, it is during this moment that your items are not completely charged so you have to wait for the end of your animation in order to > have perfect damage.

## Sweeping Edge :

> Sweeping Edge is the pvp "farm", it allows you to hit all your mobs on a longer range

##Critical Hit :

> Hitting a player while falling will land a critical hit. This does 150% the damage a normal hit would.

## Sprint Hit

![blurrys-java-pvp_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89f4c6bd-8a77-40a4-bb58-40c0f0677eee)

> When a player sprints while on the ground, they can land a sprint hit. Landing a sprint hit deals extra knockback to the player.
> - **Knocks the player 3.5 blocks back**

## OffHand Swap

![blurrys-java-pvp_15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d9cf129-9c2d-4c04-a5f3-8f8833f50337)

> Just like Java, you can swap certain items into your offhand by right clicking (LT/L2 on console). The items that can be swapped are:
>   - **Totems**
>   - **Arrows**

## Arc Punch

| Bow                       | Enchant                       | Motion                                                      
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------
| `Bow`            | Punch   | 2 

> I didn't make a video for the punch arc but it is beautiful and present.
